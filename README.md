# Flow Field Practice

This repository contains the creation of flow fields using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. Flow fields are a technique used in computer graphics and simulations to simulate fluid motion or create interesting visual effects.
Flow fields are a grid of vectors that represent the direction and magnitude of flow at each point in the grid. By manipulating these vectors, you can create various effects such as simulating wind, water, or particle systems. This repository aims to help me understand the concept of flow fields.
